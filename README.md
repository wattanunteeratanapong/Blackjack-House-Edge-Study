# Blackjack-House-Edge-Study
Have you ever wondered if the odds in Blackjack are really on the house's side? <br>
<br>

## Overview & Control Variable
- This experiment test 1v1 against dealer
- If player hand total value is lower than 17, player are gonna hit until it's more than 17 (most of the player are likely hit until their hand are higher than 17 then stop)

- Using 6 deck of card, similar to a real casino
- Reset the deck after it is below 70% of total amount, similar to a real casino

<br>

## Traditional Rules of Blackjack <br>
1. If dealer hand total value are higher than 17, dealer can't hit anymore (player doesn't affect by this rule, player still be able to hit even if their hand is equal to 17 or higher) <br>
2. If dealer hand total value are lower than 17, dealer must hit no matter what (player doesn't affect by this rule, player could decide to stand without regard to their score) <br>
3. If player win by any mean they get back x2 their bet, but if they get blackjack they get back x2.5 their bet<br>
<br>

## Why blackjack odd are on the dealer side? <br>
If we take a look at the simulation we can see the busted ratio between player and dealer, player are more often busted than a dealer. 
This is because player have to hit before the dealer this is why they busted more often than dealer.
Because of this reason the longer they play, the more they lose their money.
<br><br>

## Conclusion <br>
From this experiment if player didn't having any kind of technique and go 1v1 against dealer, they are likely to lose. 
So if you wanna get rich from Blackjack, be a dealer. <br>
Win Rate &nbsp;&nbsp;: &nbsp;≈ 0.41% <br>
Lose Rate &nbsp;: &nbsp;≈ 0.49% <br>
Tie Rate &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;: &nbsp;≈ 0.10% <br>
Dealer Busted : Player Busted ≈ 1 : 1.49
<br><br>
